## My Notes

* I considered using a Factory pattern to generate the individual rows that are rendered inside a <FlatList>. But really, the code is much more unstandable WITHOUT doing that. Right now, my code is basic but understandable. What would it look like if I create some method called "createListItem(label, styles, callback)" inside a file called ListRowFactory.js? It's more convoluted that way, and only serves to (try to) show that I'm some sort of manly-man programmer"

* Styles: I will beat the styles into submission, and have styles that are shared between similar component types.
