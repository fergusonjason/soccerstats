# Soccerstats

This is my app to track on-the-fly soccer stats to be compiled during games. It's mainly to demonstrate passing familiarity
with React Native.

I don't have a Mac, so I can only write this for Android. However, if anyone knows any poorly secured banks they can tell me
about, I'll be sure to pick one up.
